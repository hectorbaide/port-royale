				<h2>Reduce, reuse and reorder</h2><br>
				<p>The redesign was far reaching and touched every aspect of the front end of the application. In no particular order, some of the objectives were:</p>
				<img class="fullbleed" src="images/ysura-v3/old-new.jpg">

				<ol>
					
				<li><strong>Reduce the spread of actions in the application</strong><br>
Actions in the app didn’t have a consistent placement and it was often difficult to figure out where on the screen was the specific button somebody was looking for. We decided to create rules about where actions should be in the app and consolidate actions in specific places so there is no time wasted on looking for them</li><br>

<li><strong>Restructure the content for improved clarity and readability</strong>
</li><br>

<li><strong>Increase action speed</strong><br>
				Main options are available from the app menu and action shortcuts for commonly used functions were integrated there. Superfluous animation was cut leading to increased performance, especially in older devices (many of our customers use 2nd generation iPads as their main mobile platform). Infinite scrolling was added instead of paging for lists.
</li><br>

<li><strong>Create and support reusable components</strong>
</li><br>

<li><strong>Improve design language and aesthetics
</strong><br>By reducing colors, adding meaningful typographic standards and cleaning up basic level components such as lists, input boxes and buttons.
</li><br>
				</ol>

				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>Some aspects of the redesign had to be reworked or scrapped because of development issues. 
While developers were consulted and brought into discussions since the beginning of the project, many details were discussed late and while the project was already underway, leading to more changes and the need of more “quick tweaks”.</p>

	
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Reactions to the new design have been extremely positive both from existing and prospective customers. 						
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						Implementation was done in record time (approximately 1 month) thanks to well planned steps, great documentation and great developers. 
					</li>
<br>
					<li>
						Training times for users were reduced thanks to the clearer design and the new consistent patterns introduced.
					</li>
<br>
					<li>Time to deliver design for new features halved because of the consistent reuse of components.</li>
<br>
					<li>Miscommunication with developers has been reduced greatly as now we share stronger standards and conventions for components.</li>
<br>
					<li>Support calls have been reduced significantly since the redesign was launched</li>
<br>
				</ul>
