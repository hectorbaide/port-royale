				<h2>ysura is the best… can it get better?
</h2>
<h3>What is ysura?
</h3>
				<p>ysura is a Munich based marketing technology company focused on the pharmaceutical industry. Over 1000 employees from the biggest pharmaceutical companies in Germany use ysura’s main product ysura CRM.<br><br>
				The main use of ysura is to access and understand customer information for marketing and information purposes as well as for reporting marketing and informative activities made towards doctors and other healthcare professionals. Additionally, it helps drive internal processes to ensure compliance and best industry practices of their sales staff.
<br><br>
				During my first 2 years working in ysura, I was designing features based on an existing design language and interaction guidelines. At the same time I was trying to understand the pharmaceutical industry, its employees as software users and the processes through which the companies drive their business.
<br><br>

				Feature growth was fast and new requirements were arriving at a blazing speed. The app needed to support new communication channels and more complicated processes. This expansion in the features lead to a considerable growth in the app and its related services.
<br><br>
				As the functionality of the app doubled, its complexity also became considerably higher. This lead to a slight reduction our customers happiness with the product and drove us to start finding a solution. 
<br><br> 

				The old design was not capable of adequately support so many new features without compromising on usability. Besides this, very short schedules for delivery made quality control and impact analysis on the design side difficult to make.
<br><br> 
				After this period of growth, a change was needed to bring the overall quality of the product up while enabling it to support new ideas, visualizations and form factors.

				<h2>Reduce, reuse and reorder</h2>
				<p>The redesign was far reaching and touched every aspect of the front end of the application. In no particular order, some of the objectives were:</p>
				<ol>
					
				<li><strong>Reduce the spread of actions in the application</strong><br>
Actions in the app didn’t have a consistent placement and it was often difficult to figure out where on the screen was the specific button somebody was looking for. We decided to create rules about where actions should be in the app and consolidate actions in specific places so there is no time wasted on looking for them</li><br>

<li><strong>Restructure the content for improved clarity and readability</strong>
</li><br>

<li><strong>Increase action speed</strong><br>
				Main options are available from the app menu and action shortcuts for commonly used functions were integrated there. Superfluous animation was cut leading to increased performance, especially in older devices (many of our customers use 2nd generation iPads as their main mobile platform). Infinite scrolling was added instead of paging for lists.
</li><br>

<li><strong>Create and support reusable components</strong>
</li><br>

<li><strong>Improve design language and aesthetics
</strong><br>By reducing colors, adding meaningful typographic standards and cleaning up basic level components such as lists, input boxes and buttons.
</li><br>
				</ol>
<!-- Third section -->
				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>Some aspects of the redesign had to be reworked or scrapped because of development issues. 
While developers were consulted and brought into discussions since the beginning of the project, many details were discussed late and while the project was already underway, leading to more changes and the need of more “quick tweaks”.</p>

<!-- Fourth section -->
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Reactions to the new design have been extremely positive both from existing and prospective customers. 						
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						Implementation was done in record time (approximately 1 month) thanks to well planned steps, great documentation and great developers. 
					</li>
<br>
					<li>
						Training times for users were reduced thanks to the clearer design and the new consistent patterns introduced.
					</li>
<br>
					<li>Time to deliver design for new features halved because of the consistent reuse of components.</li>
<br>
					<li>Miscommunication with developers has been reduced greatly as now we share stronger standards and conventions for components.</li>
<br>
					<li>User feedback has been impressively positive and support calls have reduced since the redesign was launched</li>
<br>
				</ul>
