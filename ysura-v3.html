						<p>ysura is a Munich based marketing technology company focused on the pharmaceutical industry. Over 1000 employees from the biggest pharmaceutical companies in Germany use ysura&#39s main product ysura CRM.
						</p><p>
					ysura Version 3 was a project to redesign the front end of our product to prepare it for new the introduction of new, more powerful features and for cleaning up several parts which had become chaotic after a period of very fast growth.</p>
					<h3>Initial pitch for concept</h3>
					<p>While pitching internally we presented this idea to show how the app would become less cluttered and more understandable by the reduction of elements on screen and the consolidation of colors and controls.</p>

		<p>After release, our customer satisfaction has gone up, our support calls have gone sharply down and our production times for new features have been considerably reduced due to increased consistency and better handling of components.

			This project was made in close collaboration with the development and product teams in ysura as well as vital contributions by my design team partner at the time Ina Helms.
