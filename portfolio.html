<p>In this project, I wanted to develop for the first time end to end a website.  What better way to start than my portfolio?</p>

<h3>Super advanced technical specifications</h3>
<p>While deciding to start a web presence I was initially struck by the broad range of possibilities of how I could create my own website.</p>

<p>From using a static site generator to using a full fledged CMS or even a hacker ninja combo of MongoDB + Express + ReactJ+ Node the options seemed limitless. Unfortunately that meant also that it was difficult to focus on where to start. That’s when I thought “for the moment, I basically want to show some pretty pictures and some text” and that’s when I decided I’d hand code everything in plain HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>Why? It loads fast and I understand everything that’s happening end to end… I won’t have to call my programmer friends in case it breaks and I would learn many things about the nitty gritty of styling and making layouts.</p>

<p>There’s nothing particularly fancy going on on it in terms of Javascript frameworks or CSS preprocessors or site builders or so on because I think that the less complicated something is, the better. </p>

<p>This is why I also avoided using a CMS or similars because it would’ve increased the time to load the page and it would load many things that I don’t need.  If I decide in to start a store or suddenly I start creating much more content or I think that my site needs a considerable amount of additional animations or interactive elements or so, I’ll probably remake it in something like Webflow or Semplice and add the necessary parts then.</p>

<p>Besides that, I find writing HTML and CSS very fun. I think if you’re a programmer, you’ll find it even more amusing to see the code.  It’ll probably make for a good laugh :D if you find a bug or something similar please let me know.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>Before deciding what to develop the site in, I went through many sketches and iterations of the look and feel. After that I made some sort of task breakdown of what I needed to do. Then I cried because it was a lot of work and put it off for some weeks. Then I got married. Finally after all that, I started writing the content and compiling the necessary assets. Eventually I programmed the basic skeleton of the pages and started processing all the visual content. Add 342.7 iterations of the programming / editing content  and here it is!</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>I’ll keep adding content and updating it when projects I feel need to be showcased come up. I’ll try to keep it “professionally oriented” and also referring to real, shipped products. Concepts + Ideas + thoughts will probably go to Dribbble or Medium or my blog or whichever the dominant relevant social platform of the moment is.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and if you think we’d be a good fit to collaborate or have a chat about design/ digital stuff /music / videogames  send me an email or DM me in twitter.</p>
