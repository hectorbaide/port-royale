					<p>Pinapp was an app discovery and curation service created in 2013 and based on the thesis research from a friend and co founder who wanted to find out whether relating less popular apps with well known ones in a relevant way could improve their chances of being discovered by people.</p>
				<p>The main goal of the service was to enable people to create app collections based on several criteria to then cross reference them and suggest related apps whose relationships were not immediately obvious.</p>
