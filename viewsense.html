				<h2>Trying to find innovation in image visualization
</h2>
<h3>Why research image galleries in phones?
</h3>
				<p>Back in 2013/2014 images on mobile phones were still being navigated as if we were looking at them in our computers. Their organization was based on the tree folder structure one might find in desktop operating systems and often the only way to find one was by searching through countless folders. Even though some companies like Instagram were offering different solutions to search images, there was no way of navigating images outside of the service and the types of searches weren't optimized for personal images that were stored in device.
<br><br>

<h3>The interface</h3>
				
				<p>The interface was created in several iterations, all of them based in the same underlying concept:<br><strong>Images should be searchable across different dimensions</strong>.<br> This meant in practice that images shouldn't follow a folder structure but instead be searchable by their content characteristics. This allowed users to find images through different pathways, increasing the likelihood that someone would eventually reach the desired image. Besides that, this type of organization could allow users to create several "albums" catered to a specific use case.
				</p>
<h3>Key Ideas</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		
		Innovative organization of images</li>
<li>Innovative exploration</li>
<li>Creating a testable prototype
	</li>

</ul>

<h2>First Prototype</h2>

<h3>What went good?</h3>
<p>The tags were easily accessible and the color coding for types of tags was a good idea! This configuration also helped me to refine the tag categorization as the categories created in this prototype were too specific to be usable. This insight also lead to the idea of generalizing them and to pay deeper attention to their ontology.</p>

<h3>Main issues</h3>
<p>The interface was fast but didn't look so good. Besides that it wasn't scalable in case of having many different tags, however its main problem was that it took the focus away from the images too much. The idea though evolved to inform the final iteration of one of the image exploration modes.</p>

<h2>Second Prototype</h2>

<p>
(image1)
The design was refined to bring the focus to the images themselves. The tag exploration was given its own space and the idea that users would search tags while browsing images concurrently was proven incorrect. The focus was on drilling down to a custom set of combinations of tags.</p> 

(image 2)
<p>The second interface (visualization) offered a great way for people to understand the relationships of their images, offering insights such as figuring out that images that matched a certain mood were more likely to be paired to specific objects or seasons.</p>

(image 3)
<p>The great challenge came in this case in the implementation phase. I had not have up to this point any real experience with programming and I knew that this prototype would require me to do many complex things for it to work for testing. In spite of that, I was able to create a prototype with a filterable set of images and accurate relationship visualizations, coded in Javascript using several libraries. </p>

<p>The prototype helped me in finalizing my research but, most importantly, gave me an introduction to understanding how programmers while implementing interfaces.

<h2>UX Research</h2>

<p>After having the prototype ready, I conducted user testing, using quantitative and qualitative methods to validate the hypotheses laid out on my thesis. Besides that I learned how to systematically benchmark my design against established solutions and how to build upon these solutions to create something innovative. After all, so much work has been done on the basics that often gets ignored.

<!-- Second section -->

<!-- 				<h2>Reduce, reuse and reorder</h2>
				<p>The redesign was far reaching and touched every aspect of the front end of the application. In no particular order, some of the objectives were:</p>
				<ol>
					
				<li><strong>Reduce the spread of actions in the application</strong><br>
Actions in the app didn’t have a consistent placement and it was often difficult to figure out where on the screen was the specific button somebody was looking for. We decided to create rules about where actions should be in the app and consolidate actions in specific places so there is no time wasted on looking for them</li><br>

<li><strong>Restructure the content for improved clarity and readability</strong>
</li><br>

<li><strong>Increase action speed</strong><br>
				Main options are available from the app menu and action shortcuts for commonly used functions were integrated there. Superfluous animation was cut leading to increased performance, especially in older devices (many of our customers use 2nd generation iPads as their main mobile platform). Infinite scrolling was added instead of paging for lists.
</li><br>

<li><strong>Create and support reusable components</strong>
</li><br>

<li><strong>Improve design language and aesthetics
</strong><br>By reducing colors, adding meaningful typographic standards and cleaning up basic level components such as lists, input boxes and buttons.
</li><br>
				</ol> -->
<!-- Third section -->
				<!-- <h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>Some aspects of the redesign had to be reworked or scrapped because of development issues. 
While developers were consulted and brought into discussions since the beginning of the project, many details were discussed late and while the project was already underway, leading to more changes and the need of more “quick tweaks”.</p> -->

<!-- Fourth section -->
		<!-- 		<h2>Results</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Reactions to the new design have been extremely positive both from existing and prospective customers. 						
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						Implementation was done in record time (approximately 1 month) thanks to well planned steps, great documentation and great developers. 
					</li>
<br>
					<li>
						Training times for users were reduced thanks to the clearer design and the new consistent patterns introduced.
					</li>
<br>
					<li>Time to deliver design for new features halved because of the consistent reuse of components.</li>
<br>
					<li>Miscommunication with developers has been reduced greatly as now we share stronger standards and conventions for components.</li>
<br>
					<li>User feedback has been impressively positive and support calls have reduced since the redesign was launched</li>
<br>
				</ul> -->
