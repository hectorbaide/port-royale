			<h3>Trying to find innovation in image visualization
</h3></div>

<div class="doublecell">
				<p>Back in 2013/2014 images on mobile phones were still being navigated as if we were looking at them in our computers. Their organization was based on the folder structure found back then in desktop operating systems and often the only way to find an image was by searching through countless folders. <br>

</div>
				<div class="doublecell"><p>
				Even though some companies like Instagram were offering different solutions to search images, there was no way of navigating images <strong>within</strong> a personal phone locally and besides this the solutions in that time were not mobile optimized.</p></div></div>
<div class="grid">
		<div class="doublecell"><p>The solution proposed in my thesis was based in the idea of creating dynamic collections by organising images across three dimensions, <strong>Place</strong> (where?), <strong>Subject</strong> (who or what?) and <strong>Mood</strong> (when or how)</p><br>

<h3>The interface</h3>
		
<p><strong>Key Ideas</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		
		Innovative organization of images</li>
<li>Innovative exploration</li>
<li>Creating a testable prototype
	</li>

</ul>



<h2>UX Research</h2>

<p>After having the prototype ready, I conducted user testing, using quantitative and qualitative methods to validate the hypotheses laid out on my thesis. Besides that I learned how to systematically benchmark my design against established solutions and how to build upon these solutions to create something innovative. After all, so much work has been done on the basics that often gets ignored.
