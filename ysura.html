			<h3>Rationale behind the redesign</h3>
			<p>Ysura CRM grew tremendously in the last 2 years, duplicating its functionality and giving our users access to many new possibilities on viewing and interacting with the information they have about their customers.<br>
				After the growth however, many sections of the app became slightly disordered, and the new possibilities in actions made the current design of the application difficult to sustain.
			There are 3 main aspects where the design was improved to be able to accommodate the existing functionality and to give space to the opportunities of the future</p>
			<div>
				<p><h3>1. Information display</h3>
					Navigation controls were moved to the top of the screen and now each section consists of its own scrollable panel with all information available at a glance. The app now features different levels of headings to indicate better information structure and the font has been modified to increase readability.<br>
					Actionable items are indicated by an accent color (in our case, blue), clickable lists are indicated by a white background and non interactive elements are represented in different shades of gray, varying in darkness to indicate importance. Other colors will be used for informational purposes.
				Different list configurations and sizes were created to more efficiently display information and better utilize screen space.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p><h3>2. Consolidation of controls</h3>
					In the current application, controls are spread along all different spaces of a page. While this offers the advantage of relating the control with a specific part of a page (f. ex. the Stammdaten of a Person), it also makes the placement of controls difficult to remember and it forces the user to navigate to the specific section where they want to execute an action. Some controls also were deemed confusing by different users, such as the toggles and a couple of single selection controls in wizards.<br>
				Controls are placed always in the same spot:</p>
				<p>Editing is always on the header of section to be edited and creation actions are always available through the action plus button located on the bottom right corner of the screen.
					The action button is context dependent and its content changes depending on the available actions.
				Single selection controls and controls for changing views are improved for clarity.</p>
